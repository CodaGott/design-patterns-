# Observer Pattern

Observer pattern has to do with at least two objects.
//  Where one of the Object is the Subject and the other is the listener.
//  When an activity happens within the subject class,
//  It notifies the Listener/Observer object.
//  This is aimed to make the objects not tightly coupled.
